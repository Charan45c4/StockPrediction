This project is a web application built with Flask that predicts stock closing prices utilizing LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. It allows users to input a company code, which fetches historical stock data from a corresponding CSV file, visualizes trends, and provides predicted future values using deep learning techniques.

Features
Interactive web interface for stock prediction.

Input a stock's company code to analyze its historical prices.

Data visualization: closing price, sales volume, and moving averages.

LSTM model training and prediction on the fly.

Comparison of actual and predicted values.

Results presented with interactive plots and tables.

Technologies Used
Python (Flask, Pandas, NumPy)

Matplotlib for visualizations

scikit-learn for data preprocessing

Keras with TensorFlow backend for deep learning (LSTM)

HTML templates for the web interface
